HTMacros -- The HyperText Macros
Kyle Miller 2011

1. So what is this?

This is a bunch of macros which resemble LaTeX syntax, and whose
output is text-based markup, namely HTML.  This is for the purpose of
using Emacs' great LaTeX mode to produce my web site, and to prevent
the necessity of using HTML.

An example of the output of this software is at

2. How do I use it?

Please examine the documentation, which is at both:

* http://web.mit.edu/kmill/www/htmacros_doc.html

* and in the doc directory.  The documentation may be built by running
  doc/makedoc, and the result is placed in doc/doc_html.
