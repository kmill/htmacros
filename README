HTM -- The HyperText Macros
Kyle Miller 2011

1. Introduction

This is different from mht because there is no intermediate macro
expansion language.  I don't think that was a good idea before.

It's also not scython's sml since it turned out to be too slow to have
an intermediate scheme to do the macro conversion.  Why was there
intermediate scheme?  I wanted tail call optimization to be able to
implement the parser.

It's also not hml because there's too much state to comfortably
program the first time through.

1.1. So what is this?

It's a bunch of macros which mimic LaTeX syntax which become HTML.
This is for the purpose of using Emacs great LaTeX mode to produce my
web site, and to prevent the necessity of using HTML.
